# Plant-Species-Classification-Computer-Vision-with-CNN
Classification of plant species based on plant images using Computer Vision with CNN

DOMAIN: Botanical research

CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data

PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Universityâ€™s management requires an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

We will build models and compare them for performance
- Use supervised learning algorithms for training
- Use neural networks for training
- Use CNN for training
